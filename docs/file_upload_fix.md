# Screenshot and File Management Fix

This fix addresses the issue of not being able to save files in the database for the Trading Journal App.

## Changes Made

1. Added a dedicated upload endpoint in the backend:
   - Created `backend/api/routes/uploads.py` with endpoints for handling file uploads
   - Added the routes to the FastAPI application in `main.py`

2. Created necessary directories for file storage:
   - `/Users/itamarmacbook/Desktop/tradingjournalapp/static/screenshots`
   - `/Users/itamarmacbook/Desktop/tradingjournalapp/cloud_storage`

3. Added static file serving in the FastAPI application:
   - Set up StaticFiles middleware to serve files from the static and cloud_storage directories

4. Enhanced the frontend to support file uploads:
   - Created a new ImageUploader component
   - Updated the TradeForm to use the ImageUploader component
   - Added proper state management for screenshots

## How to Test

1. Restart your application:
   ```
   ./restart_app.sh
   ```

2. Try adding a new trade with screenshots or editing an existing trade to add screenshots.

3. The files should now be properly stored on the filesystem and their paths saved in the database.

## Technical Details

- Files are stored on the filesystem rather than directly in the database
- The database stores the file paths
- Static files are served directly by FastAPI
- File uploads use multipart/form-data encoding

## Further Improvements

For a production environment, consider:

1. Adding authentication to file uploads
2. Implementing file size and type validation
3. Setting up cloud storage for more reliable file storage
4. Adding image optimization for better performance
