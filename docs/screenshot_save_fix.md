# Comprehensive Database Fix

This patch resolves multiple database issues in the trading journal application, including:

## What's Fixed

1. **DateTime Handling**: The app now properly converts ISO-format datetime strings to Python datetime objects, resolving the "SQLite DateTime type only accepts Python datetime and date objects as input" error.

2. **JSON Field Handling**: The application properly formats and processes JSON data for SQLite storage.
   - Added proper JSON serialization/deserialization for the `screenshots` and `tags` fields
   - Created utility functions in `utils/json_helpers.py` to handle JSON processing

3. **Date String Parsing**: Added robust date/time parsing to handle various date formats.
   - New `date_helpers.py` module with comprehensive date parsing functionality
   - Support for ISO dates with 'Z' timezone marker and other common formats

4. **Error Handling**: Added robust error handling and logging for better diagnostics
   - Detailed logging in trade creation/update endpoints
   - Error trapping for data conversion issues

5. **Database Permissions**: Fixed potential permission issues with database access
   - Added a script to ensure proper file permissions
   - Created missing directories with appropriate access rights

6. **Frontend/Backend Communication**: Improved how screenshots and datetime values are passed from frontend to backend
   - Added debug logging to track data flow
   - Updated frontend components to properly format data for API calls

## How to Apply the Fix

Run the `fix_screenshot_db.sh` script from the project root directory:

```bash
chmod +x fix_screenshot_db.sh
./fix_screenshot_db.sh
```

This script will:
1. Back up your current database
2. Fix file permissions
3. Create missing directories
4. Restart the application

## Technical Details

- The primary issue was in how datetime fields (entry_time, exit_time) were being processed
- SQLite requires proper Python datetime objects, not ISO string formats
- We've implemented a triple-layer validation approach:
  1. Pydantic model conversion in the schemas
  2. Service-layer date parsing in the trade service
  3. Repository-layer fallback conversion with comprehensive format support

This ensures that no matter how dates arrive (from frontend, API calls, or other sources), they'll be properly formatted for SQLite.

## Testing the Fix

After applying the fix:
1. Add a new trade with screenshots
2. Check that both datetime values and screenshots save properly
3. Edit an existing trade
4. Verify that all changes persist as expected

If you still encounter issues, check the backend logs for detailed error messages which now include type information for better debugging.
