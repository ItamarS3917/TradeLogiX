# Dashboard Widget System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the dashboard widget system, which will allow users to customize their dashboard layout with various widget types.

## Widget Types

We'll implement the following widget types initially:

1. **Performance Summary Widget**
   - Displays key trading metrics (win rate, P&L, etc.)
   - Includes sparkline charts for trends
   - Configurable to show different time periods

2. **P&L Chart Widget**
   - Interactive chart showing profit/loss over time
   - Supports different chart types (line, area, candlestick)
   - Configurable timeframes and data granularity

3. **Recent Trades Widget**
   - Displays most recent trades in a list
   - Shows trade outcome, P&L, and key details
   - Configurable to show different number of trades

4. **Win/Loss Distribution Widget**
   - Pie chart or donut chart showing win/loss ratio
   - Includes percentage calculations
   - Configurable to filter by setup type, time period, etc.

5. **TradeSage Insights Widget**
   - Displays AI-generated insights about trading patterns
   - Shows suggestions for improvement
   - Updates automatically with new trades

6. **Trading Calendar Widget**
   - Shows upcoming market events
   - Displays scheduled trading sessions
   - Integrates with planning module

7. **Setup Performance Widget**
   - Bar chart showing performance by setup type
   - Includes win rate, average P&L, etc.
   - Sortable by different metrics

8. **Time-of-Day Performance Widget**
   - Heatmap showing performance by time of day
   - Helps identify optimal trading hours
   - Configurable to show different metrics

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Layout System

Implement a grid-based layout system using react-grid-layout:
- Responsive design with different breakpoints
- Draggable and resizable widgets
- Layout persistence in local storage

### 2. Widget Framework

Create a modular widget framework:
- Base widget component with common functionality
- Widget registry for dynamic loading
- Widget configuration interface
- Layout management system

### 3. Individual Widget Implementation

For each widget type:
- Create dedicated component
- Implement data fetching and processing
- Add configuration options
- Design responsive layout

### 4. Widget Management UI

Implement interface for managing widgets:
- Add/remove widgets
- Configure widget settings
- Save/load dashboard layouts
- Reset to default layout

### 5. State Persistence

Implement dashboard state persistence:
- Save layout in localStorage initially
- Later sync with user profile in backend
- Versioning system for layout changes

## Technical Design

### Widget Component Structure

Each widget will follow a common structure:
- Widget container with metadata
- Widget header with title, controls
- Widget content area
- Configuration panel

### Data Fetching Strategy

- Use React hooks for data fetching
- Implement caching for improved performance
- Support real-time updates for critical widgets
- Handle loading and error states consistently

### Layout Management

- Store layout in a normalized format
- Support multiple layouts (default, custom)
- Implement responsive breakpoints
- Add auto-arranging for newly added widgets

## Dependencies Required

- `react-grid-layout`: For drag-and-drop grid layout
- `recharts` or `nivo`: For advanced chart visualizations
- `@mui/material`: For UI components
- `date-fns`: For date manipulation

## Next Steps

1. Install required dependencies
2. Implement basic layout system
3. Create widget registry
4. Implement first widget type (Performance Summary)
5. Test and refine the implementation
