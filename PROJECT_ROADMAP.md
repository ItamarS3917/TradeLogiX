## Frontend Migration Plan

### Current Status
- **frontend/**: Original implementation using Create React App (CRA) with webpack
  - Has dependency conflicts and outdated libraries
  - Not recommended for further development

- **frontend-new/**: Modern implementation using Vite
  - Core structure implemented (authentication, routing, API services)
  - Currently under active development
  - **Recommended directory for all frontend development**

### Migration Path
1. Continue implementing all features in the **frontend-new/** directory
2. Use the original frontend code as reference only
3. Once migration is complete, backup the original frontend directory if needed
4. Rename **frontend-new/** to **frontend/** for consistency
5. Update Docker configurations and scripts accordingly

**Important:** To avoid confusion and maintain a clear development path, all new frontend development should happen exclusively in the **frontend-new/** directory. The original frontend directory should be considered legacy code and not modified.

## Long-Term Project Phases

### 1. Complete Frontend Migration (1-2 weeks)

- [x] Setup proper project structure in frontend-new:
  ```
  frontend-new/
  ├── src/

  │   ├── services/       # API services
  │   ├── hooks/          # Custom hooks
  │   ├── contexts/       # React contexts (auth, etc.)

  │   ├── styles/         # Global styles
  │   └── assets/         # Images, fonts, etc.
  ```
- [x] Install required dependencies from original frontend:
  ```bash
