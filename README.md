### Using Docker (Recommended)
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tradingjournalapp.git
cd tradingjournalapp
```

2. Copy the environment file and add your Anthropic API key:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

3. Build and run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Manual Setup

#### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tradingjournalapp.git
cd tradingjournalapp
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

5. Run the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend-new
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
